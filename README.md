# GestureMath

GestureMath is a project developed during the Innovation Marathon organized by Code Unnati and SAP. It's an application that leverages machine learning and web technologies to enable users to solve math problems using hand gestures captured through a webcam. The project aims to provide an interactive and engaging way for users to learn and practice math concepts.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Hand Gesture Recognition:** Utilizes machine learning models, such as MediaPipe, for real-time recognition of hand gestures.
- **Interactive Web Interface:** Provides an interactive web interface for users to control and interact with math problems.
- **Streaming Capabilities:** Offers streaming capabilities via Flask, allowing seamless real-time interaction with the webcam feed.
- **Engaging Learning Experience:** Combines intuitive hand gestures with dynamic math problems to create an immersive learning experience.
